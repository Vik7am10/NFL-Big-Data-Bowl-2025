# NFL-Big-Data-Bowl-2025
The tight end position is the ultimate multi-purpose position in the NFL. They have varied responsibilities - tight ends can stay in the offensive line to block, run a short or long route, chip defenders before releasing into a route and even line up in the backfield as an H-back. Due to this vast range of possible roles, defenses are often unsure what a tight end on the field is about to do when the ball is snapped.

Every tight end could have possibly four roles on a given play if they are on the field: blocking, running a route, chipping a blocker and releasing, or being in motion as a decoy or H-back.

In this project, we analyze the post-snap behaviour, action and usage of each tight end on a play using pre-snap tracking data. Our model aims to provide data-driven insights that predict one of the above four outcomes for each tight end on the field at any given point with actionable insights to help better prepare defenses.
